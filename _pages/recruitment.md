## One Research Fellow position, Simulation Modelling and Bayesian Optimization, under A/P Ng Szu Hui, NUS ISEM

We have an opening position for a Research Fellow in the area of simulation modelling and optimization.  The emphasis will be on metamodeling for computer simulations and algorithmic development for simulation optimization. Knowledge of Gaussian Process (GP) models and Bayesian Optimization (BO) would be an advantage, but not a requirement.  Experience with high dimensional data and machine learning techniques would also be a plus.

**Qualifications**

•	Ph.D. degree in Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Statistics and Mathematics or a related science or engineering discipline.

•	Strong background in analytical modeling, applied statistics and applied probability.

•	Good scientific writing skills.

•	Good programming skills in Python or MATLAB.

We are considering applicants with strong analytical skills and programming knowledge. Interested candidates should email their detailed curriculum vitae with details of research experience and list of publications to isensh@nus.edu.sg with the title “Application for Research Fellow in Sim Opt”. Review or interview of applicants will begin as soon as possible and will continue until both positions are filled.
